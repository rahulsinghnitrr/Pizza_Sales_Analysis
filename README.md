# Pizza_Sales_Analysis

This project provides a detailed analysis of pizza sales data by using a set of SQL queries to address important business questions faced by pizza restaurants. The repository includes various scripts designed to explore key aspects of sales and operations, such as calculating the total revenue generated, identifying the most popular pizza types and sizes, evaluating sales trends over time, and measuring the revenue contribution of each pizza category. The SQL files showcase advanced data analysis techniques, including window functions, aggregations, ranking, and complex joins. Each query is written to extract meaningful insights that can support better business decisionsâ€”such as determining peak sales hours, recognizing the most profitable menu items, and identifying customer preferences for different pizza types and sizes.
Overall, this project provides a practical and hands-on approach for anyone interested in learning and applying SQL-based data analytics to extract meaningful insights and support data-driven decision-making.
